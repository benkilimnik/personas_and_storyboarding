            <p>
                The end of the covid19-quiet-period has breathed new life into dining halls at Brown University.
                Although dining is limited to pickup at the moment, students have a gained a new option: pre-ordered,
                customized meals from Andrews Dining Hall via the GET mobile app. In this project, I set out to examine
                students' experiences with the UI of the GET app. Based on three interviews, I have crafted two personas
                and a storyboard showing the process of ordering food from start to finish.

                Interface
            </h2>
            <p>The GET app is currently the only way to order food at Andrews. It is a public interface downloadable
                from the app store and features information on remaining meal credits as well as the Andrew's menu.
                <br><br>
                A meal can be scheduled for a specific pickup time and when it is ready for pickup, the user
                receives a push notification.</p>

            <h3>Key Observations</h3>
            <p>
                I interviewed 3 on-campus students: Joe, Stella, and Melinda. (I have changed their names for
                privacy.)<br><br>
                <em>Melinda</em> said she likes to open app several times a day to check for menu changes and enjoys
                customizing
                her meals.
                During the interview, she took twice as long as Joe and Stella to place an order and navigated between
                menu items more often. <br><br>
                <em>Joe and Stella</em> say they order their meals around 15 minutes before pickup, while Melinda orders
                her meals
                more than 1 hour in advance. Joe
                wishes there was a faster way to reorder meals because he tends to order the same meal over and over
                again. <br><br>
                <em>Joe and Stella</em> dislike the need to login and authenticate each time the app is opened, which
                Joe claims takes longer than ordering a meal. Melinda did not mention the login page. <br><br>
                <em>All three</em> thought the layout was confusing the first time they used the app, featuring many
                "meaningless" buttons and tabs. For instance, the favorites button (which allows favoriting a dining
                hall) and the
                saved addresses button were viewed as misleading or unnecessary. On the "Explore" tab, the greyed out
                "Start
                Order" button was viewed as particularly confusing because it looks like it can't be clicked on.

            <h3>Responses</h3>
            <p>A detailed break down of the interview can be found by clicking on the blue button below. </p>
            <button class="collapsible">Detailed Interview Responses</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="qs">How often have you opened the GET app today? How about this week?<br></p>
                <p>Joe: Twice today, 7 times this week.<br>
                    Stella: Once today, 11 times this week.<br>
                    Melinda: Four times today, around 30 times this week.</p>
                <p class="qs">What do you use the GET app for?<br></p>
                <p>Joe, Stella, and Melinda: To order food from Andrews or refill my bear bucks account. </p>
                <p class="qs">Have you ever been confused or frustrated by the app?<br></p>
                <p>Joe: It forces you to login with phone authentication every time you open the app, and no matter how
                    many
                    times I check the "remember me" box, it never does. It also takes a long time to load
                    sometimes.<br><br>

                    Stella: If you go to the explore tab and tap on a dining hall, the "Start Order" button is greyed
                    out. I
                    was
                    confused the first time because everywhere else in the app a greyed out button can't be pushed and
                    means
                    I forgot to select something.<br><br>

                    Melinda: Sometimes the transitions are disorienting. If you tap on a menu item, then go back by
                    tapping on
                    the
                    x, the screen moves from right to left. This is counterintuitive, because it seems like you're going
                    forward not back.<br>
                </p>
                <p class="qs">How long did it take to place an order at Andrews the first time you used the app?<br></p>
                <p>Joe: Longer than it should have<br><br>

                    Stella: 10 minutes. There are many distracting buttons. The first time I tapped on all the bottom
                    navigation
                    tabs only to realize they all lead to the same place: Andrews takeout or Bearbucks refill. <br><br>

                    Melinda: 5 minutes<br>
                </p>
                <p class="qs">How far in advance did you order food using the GET app interface today?<br></p>
                <p>Joe: 10 minutes max. I set my pickup time to ASAP every time and am usually already on my way to
                    Andrews.<br><br>

                    Stella: Several hours. I usually order all my meals in the morning and set pickup times for lunch
                    and
                    dinner.<br><br>

                    Melinda: 15 minutes<br>
                </p>
                <p class="qs">Are there any features you wish the GET app had?<br></p>

                <p>Joe: I wish I could favorite my meals so I can reorder them quickly without having to reselect
                    everything.
                    The current "Favorites" button is misleading, because it only allows me to favorite a dining hall.
                    Since
                    we only have Andrews (Blue Room is for staff only) this feature is pointless.<br><br>

                    Stella: I wish there was a tab showing both the Andrew's and Vdub's menu on several days. This would
                    really
                    help me plan out my meals in advance. Right now I am having to switch between the Dining hall
                    website
                    and the app, which is annoying.<br><br>

                    Melinda: It's hard to see all the options you have. Vdub menu isn't listed, so have to cross check
                    with
                    the
                    dining website.<br>
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <p>Based on these interviews, I have created two personas.</p>
            <h3>Roger</h3>
            <p>Roger is a junior at Brown University living on-campus. For convenience, he has chosen to stay on meal
                plan and his favorite dining hall is Andrews. Roger can't get enough of Andrew's breakfast burritos, but
                he only wishes he could get them faster.<br><br>

                Roger is studying Computer Science-Economics and practically runs Brown's annual hackathon as well as
                the Entrepreneurship Program. He is currently recruiting for summer internships in software engineering
                and consulting, and is always rushing from one zoom meeting to the next. As a result, his meal times
                need to be fast and efficient. <br><br>

                <em>Roger represents a busy college student who doesn't want to spend much time thinking about what to
                    eat.
                    Like most people his age, Roger interacts with various apps on his smartphone on a daily basis, and
                    likes to order food as quickly as possible. He is frustrated by the inability to quickly reorder a
                    favorite meal using the GET app, and by the need to login everytime the app is launched. </em></p>
            <img id="myImg" src="./assets/Roger.png" alt="mountain">


            <h3>Molly</h3>
            <p>Molly is a sophomore living on-campus at Brown studying Biology. She is conscious about her diet and
                makes an effort to eat healthy. As a result, Molly likes to be well informed about her
                dining options
                and likes customizing her meals from Andrews with the GET app.<br><br> Molly enjoys planning out her day
                in
                advance and often orders her meals ahead of time. She likes variety and checks the menu frequently
                to see if any of the options have changed. <br><br>

                <em>Molly is representative of Brown students who like to plan out their meals in advance and be
                    conscientious about what they eat. She checks the app's menu often and wishes she could compare it
                    to other dining halls within the app. She finds the layout somewhat disorienting, and was especially
                    confused by the greyed out "Start Order" button the first time she used the app. </em></p>
            <img id="myImg" src="./assets/Molly.png" alt="mountain">

            <h2>Storyboard for Molly</h2>
            <h3>This storyboard pertains to Molly's persona because:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>It shows that she was very happy to receive food from Andrews exactly how she ordered it with the
                    GET app</li><br>
                <li>It demonstrates that she plans out her meals hours in advance, using the GET app's scheduled pickup
                    functionality. </li><br>
                <li>It exemplifies her desire to consider her dining options and spend time browsing through the menu as
                    she customizes her meals</li><br>
                <li>
                    It expresses that she was disoriented by the many buttons and tabs when first opening the GET app,
                    and that she was particularly confused by the greyed out order button on the "Explore" tab
                </li><br>
            </ol>
